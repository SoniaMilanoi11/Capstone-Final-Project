 Created Basic site sign up, basic site layout with css styling

Credibility and Completeness of Presented Work:
Summary:
The presented work is the most basic version of the site. The visual aspects of the site are in HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript. The code presented, when hosted will present a basic website with a homepage and later on, additional landing pages based on content featured on the site; i.e. different chapters that the user can go through on the website, etc. 
The presented code also includes a sign-up methodology where users will create accounts in order to access the content on the site. The sign up is via email, and users create user IDs and passwords which will allow them to access the course and track their progress. Additionally, the sign-up methodology includes email confirmations to adhere to industry standards.

Strengths:
The site backbone is strong and provides a very simple and straightforward layout for the user to register for the course and access the site content without having to navigate through several landing pages.

Weaknesses:
As is, the site is not yet hosted as was decided upon for this deliverable. Therefore, what was meant to be a prototype version of the side is only the code that should be able to run, when correctly hosted to reveal the site. Hosting the site would require a financial input which I was not ready to commit to just yet, however, I intend to have the site running for the peer feedback assignment as discussed in earlier classes, as well as the completed first chapter of the tutorial available for demo from my peer assessor (and my Capstone Professor).


HC and LO usage:

#cs162-webstandards: Build systems that correctly use the standard web technologies (e.g. http, html) 
Decided to use javascript to create the site since it would make it easier to incorporate the LMS which is based on Joomla! Adding javascript to Joomla! APIs is much more easy that Python and Javascript allows for a more modern and enhanced end user experience as opposed to just using HTML and CSS3, which are also used to modify the visual appearance of the website.

#CS162communication: Ensure that all code, documentation and commit messages are clearly written with explanations where appropriate.
Ensured that my code is well commented and explains the function of each section of the code. Separated the code according to different functions the sections of the code play in having the site come together (i.e. on the client side; the sign up functions and on the server side, the site structure in html and css).
